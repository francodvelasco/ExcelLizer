# ExcelLizer
Convert Images to Excel Files

### About

ExcelLizer is a Python program that converts any image supported by Python (such as jpg and png files) into an Excel worksheet colored to match a scaled down version of the image. Final Project for ArtAp 10 (Art Appreciation).

It first generates a Excel worksheet with specialized conditional formatting such that each cell would reflect a certain shade of Red, Blue or Green depending on the number placed within it, if the Excel file doesn't exist yet for the photo. It then reads each pixel of the scaled down image provided by the user to determine its color value in 24-bit RGB format, then places the numbers derived from the RGB value into a group of 3 cells on the Excel worksheet generated by the program. Each group of 3 cells would simulate a square pixel that can be found on the very screen you're reading this on. Once the Excel file is generated, it is best that the Excel worksheet be zoomed out to 25% to make the image properly visible.

To avoid Excel crashes, the image automatically gets downscaled if its resolution on any of its dimensions exceeds 250 pixels.

### In Action
Here's a sample image that could be processed with ExcelLizer:

And here's that same image after processing:

### Executing ExcelLizer
There exists two methods to ExcelLize an image: through the Command Line Interface, and through a Graphics User Interface (GUI). The user can choose which ever one they want to use, though the GUI one might be easier to use.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
1. Download the ```excellizer.py``` file.
2. Open your favorite Command Line Interface (Powershell, Terminal, etc) in the folder where you downloaded the ```excellizer.py``` file.
3. In the CLI, execute the python file using Python 3.
    -  Windows / Linux: ```python excellizer.py```
    -  MacOS: ```python3 excellizer.py```
4. When prompted, enter the name and location of the image file that you wish to ExcelLize. For the easiest experience, it's best that the image you want to process be in the same folder as the ```excellizer.py``` file, as you'll just have to put in the name of the image file and its extension.
    - For instance: ```/location/to/image.png```
5. Press enter, and after some time, your image has been Excellized! The Excel file is located in the same folder as the Python file.

#### Graphics User Interface (GUI)
1. Download the ```excellizer.py``` and ```excel-lizer_GUI.py``` file.
2. Open your favorite Command Line Interface (Powershell, Terminal, etc) in the folder where you downloaded the ```excel-lizer_GUI.py``` file.
3. In the CLI, execute the python file using Python 3.
    -  Windows / Linux: ```python excel-lizer_GUI.py```
    -  MacOS: ```python3 excel-lizer_GUI.py```
4. When prompted, select the image you wish to Excellize through your machine's file explorer.
5. Once you select an image, it'll appear within the window as the last opportunity for you to check if you chose the same file.
6. Once you're confident, select `Excellize!`, and after some time, your image has been Excellized! The Excel file is located in the same folder as the Python file.
